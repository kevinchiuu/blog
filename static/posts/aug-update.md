In the month of August, WiHi, in no particular order:

## 1. Continued improvement and development on WiHi's frontend and backend. 

For our frontend, we have continued to implement dashboard features targeting professional users with multiple stations such as visualizing multiple stations in user profiles. 

For our backend, we are continuing to stitch the frontend and backend together to ensure that the features developed on the frontend display proper data.

We are also working hard on fixing bugs: much of the work this month has focused on this. 

## 2. Continued with WiHi's ML development efforts. WiHi began the process of capturing and vetting historical data for use in our QC models. WiHi, so far, has pulled 500,238 historical data points spanning a few years into the past, with some as early as 2018. Historical data is vital for building world-class models. 

## 3. Began working with a community member to on-board WeatherXM devices. While WeatherXM is the closest to a competitor in the web3 space (although they are actually more like data providers), they currently hold the majority of the mindshare in the crypto-space. On-boarding their user base will increase WiHi's penetration in the web3 space.
